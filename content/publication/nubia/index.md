abstract: We present NUBIA, a methodology to build automatic evaluation metrics for text generation using only machine learning models as core components. A typical NUBIA model is composed of three modules a neural feature extractor, an aggregator and a calibrator. We demonstrate an implementation of NUBIA which outperforms metrics currently used to evaluate machine translation, summaries and slightly exceeds/matches state of the art metrics on correlation with human judgement on the WMT segment-level Direct Assessment task, sentence-level ranking and image captioning evaluation. The model implemented is modular, explainable and set to continuously improve over time.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We show that a multitask feature extraction and aggregation can model human perception of similarity of translated sentences much better than standart n-gram level distance metrics.
