abstract: We review the limitations of BLEU and ROUGE â€“ the most popular metrics used to assess reference summaries against hypothesis summaries, and come up with criteria for what a good metric should behave like and propose concrete ways to use and test recent Transformers-based Language Models to assess reference summaries against hypothesis summaries. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: New method for assessing the quaility of similarity evaluators and showing potential of Transformer-based language models in replacing BLEU and ROUGE.
