I am currently in my fourth year of pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at Boston University, where I am being mentored by Derry Wijaya. Previouly I have worked at Amazon with Dr.Emilio Monti and at Fair,Meta where I worked with Dr.Dieuwke Hupkes. My previous research focused on developing strong cross-lingual representation learning techniques and evaluating machine translation systems. Currently, my interest lies in deepening my understanding of evaluations for Large Language Models (LLMs). This involves exploring the concept of generalization in these models, examining the methods used to measure their generalization capabilities, and investigating potential unnoticed factors, such as contamination, that might affect our evaluation methods. Additionally, I have a keen interest in working on computational social science projects, particularly those that I believe have a significant impact.
